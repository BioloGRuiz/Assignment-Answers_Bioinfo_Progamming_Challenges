# Assignment 2
The user can modify the name of the generated .txt, as well as testing with different depths! :P

It should be noted that a depth value equal to or greater than 4 starts taking a long time (depending on the processing capacity of the computer), due to the large number of interactions that the computer must process.

It should also be taken into consideration that the longer it takes to process all these interactions, the more likely it is that our process will be interrupted due to a possible disconnection of the Internet service, downtime of one of the servers, etc.

For everything to properly work, you have to type the following in the terminal:

```console
mark@pc:~$ main.rb ArabidopsisSubNetwork_GeneList.txt [name of final report].txt [depth number]
         ___
