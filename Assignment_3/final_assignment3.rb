## 1) We will retrieve the sequences of the Arabidopsis genes, using BioRuby:

def get_embl(file)
  loci_codes=Hash.new # Saving the AGI Loci codes and their EMBL entries in an instance variable hash
    File.open(file).each do |gene|
      gene.strip! # Removing leading and trailing whitespace from str. Returns nil if str was not altered --> https://apidock.com/ruby/String/strip%21
      response = fetch("http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/dbfetch/dbfetch?db=ensemblgenomesgene&format=embl&id=#{gene}&style=raw") # Database selected --> Ensembl Genomes Gene (ensemblgenomesgene)
      if response
        embl=Bio::EMBL.new(response.body) # Here we will apply the BioRuby Class "Bio::EMBL", which enable us to represent the database records selected
        loci_codes[gene]=embl # Saving the AGI Loci codes and their EMBL entries in the hash previously defined
      end
    end
  return loci_codes
end

# The Bio::EMBL object finds every 'CTTCTT' sequence in the exons of each gene.
# We will add the features selected to a new Bio::Sequence object, which will contain all the previous information of the Bio::EMBL object

  #pos_list --> list in which we introduced the coordinates of every CTTCTT sequence
  #strand --> DNA strand orientation. Positive --> '+', negative --> '-' (complementary). BioRuby reads and presents sequences in 5' â†’ 3'
  #bioseq --> Bio::Sequence object, made from a Bio::EMBL object to be able to add features to it
  pos_list.each do |pos|
    ft=Bio::Feature.new('CTTCTT_repetition',pos) # just creating a Bio::Feature object --> http://bioruby.org/rdoc/Bio/Feature.html
    ft.append(Bio::Feature::Qualifier.new('repeat_motif','cttctt')) # here we add some qualifier-value pairs for sequence features --> http://bioruby.org/rdoc/Bio/Feature/Qualifier.html
